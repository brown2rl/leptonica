 Visual Studio 2010 Notes
==========================

* Programs built with Visual Studio 2010 can link with the **static**
  binary libraries supplied in the |liblept| :doc:`Visual Studio 2008
  pre-built binaries for Windows archive <downloading-binaries>`.

  You can also link with the **dynamic** binary libraries as long as you
  follow these rules:

  * Any memory allocated by |liblept| has be be freed with the new
    ``lept_free()`` function. For example, this includes the strings
    returned by ``getLeptonicaVersion()``, ``getImagelibVersions()``,
    and ``genTempFilename()``, and the data created by
    ``pixWriteMemTiff()``.

  * Any file handles required by |liblept| have to be created by the
    new ``lept_fopen()`` function and closed with the new
    ``lept_fclose()`` function.
  
  Failure to follow these rules will result in a crash due to the
  simultaneous use of two incompatible C Runtime DLLs (`msvcr90.dll` and
  `msvcr100.dll`). See `Using Visual Studio 2010, how can one link to a
  DLL generated by Visual Studio 2008
  <http://stackoverflow.com/q/4171403>`_ for the gory details.

* When converting the VS2008 Solution, you'll get a number of warnings
  like the following in the Conversion Report::

    MSB8012: $(TargetName) ('liblept168') does not match the Librarian's OutputFile property value 'LIB Debug\liblept168-static-mtdll-debug.lib' ('liblept168-static-mtdll-debug') in project configuration 'LIB Debug|Win32'. This may cause your project to build incorrectly. To correct this, please make sure that $(TargetName) property value matches the value specified in %(Lib.OutputFile).

  Fix the :guilabel:`liblept`\ |vnumG| project by doing the following:

  1. Right-click on :guilabel:`liblept`\ |vnumG| and choose
     :menuselection:`P&roperties`.

  #. Then change :guilabel:`liblept`\ |vnumG| :guilabel:`Property Pages
     | General | Target Name` to one of the following values:

     For the :guilabel:`LIB Debug` Configuration::

        $(ProjectName)-static-mtdll-debug

     For the :guilabel:`LIB Release` Configuration::

        $(ProjectName)-static-mtdll

     For the :guilabel:`DLL Debug` Configuration::

        $(ProjectName)d

  The :guilabel:`ioformats_reg` project also needs to be fixed:

  1. Right-click on :guilabel:`ioformats_reg` and choose
     :menuselection:`P&roperties`.

  #. From the :guilabel:`&Configuration` dropdown menu choose
     :guilabel:`All Configurations`.

  #. Change :guilabel:`ioformats_reg Property Pages | Linker | General |
     Output File` to::
     
        $(OutDir)$(TargetName)$(TargetExt)

  #. You still need to follow the instructions at :ref:`create a new
     Visual Studio Project <building-prog-programs-vs2008>`.

  Exit and restart Visual Studio (or close and reopen the |liblept|
  solution).

* To use the "Create Leptonica prog Project AddIn" follow the
  :ref:`instructions <building-prog-programs-vs2008>` for Visual Studio
  2008 but copy `vs2008\\CreateLeptonicaProgProjects.AddIn` and
  `vs2008\\CreateLPP.dll` to your Visual Studio 2010 Addins folder
  (normally `C:\\My Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Addins`).

  Edit `CreateLeptonicaProgProjects.AddIn` and change::

     <Version>9.0</Version>
 
  to::

     <Version>10.0</Version>

* The :doc:`building <building-image-libraries>` of the image libraries
  has not been tested using Visual Studio 2010. Given the problems
  encountered while building |liblept| you can probably expect to have
  some issues.
